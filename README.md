Card:

I created a card to display the sum of sales, quantity, profit, and discount so that users can get the total sales, profit, quantity, and discount. Each card displays a single, prominent numerical value. Sum of Sales: Shows the total revenue generated. Sum of Quantity: Reflects the total number of items sold. Sum of Profit: Indicates the total profit earned. Sum of Discount: Displays the total discounts applied.

Slicer:

I created a slicer to display the state, then we check sales profit state-wise. The slicer provides an interactive way for users to focus on specific states within the data. By selecting a particular state.

table:

I created a table to display City by sum of sales and profit.The table provides a clear and organised way to view detailed data on sales and profit at the city level. It allows users to see exact figures for each city and identify city-wise sales and profit.Â 

Stacked column chart:

I created a stacked column chart to display city by sales and quantity separately so that users can choose the specific sales city and quantity that they want to focus on. Users can see how sales and quantity contribute to the overall performance in each city.

pie chart:

I created three pie charts to display categories by sum of sales, profit, and quantity performance. Each pie chart provides a clear and concise view of sales profit quantity by category.

area chart:

I created an area chart to display the sum of profit by state and segment so that users can check state-wise profit and segment. It not only helps users see the overall profit but also allows them to understand how each segment contributes to the total profit in each state.

Stacked bar chart:

I created a stacked bar chart to display the sum of sales by subcategory performance. Users can check sub-category-wise sales.
